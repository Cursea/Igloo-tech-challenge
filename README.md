# Income tax calculator (backend)

### Igloo tech challenge

My _attempt_ (note the emphasis!) to complete my first ever technical interview challenge; a Node.js + Express backend for a UK Income Tax calculator.

#### Setup

After cloning this repo to your local machine, you'll need to install the packages using node by running `npm install`.

Use the node command `npm start` to get the server up and running.

A request to calculate a gross salary can be sent to the root (/) endpoint, using either the REST method (accessible in _at least_ VSCode) or similar (e.g. Postman). The app expects the request body to contain `grossSalary: Number`.

#### Notes

There will be some unit tests (using Jest) shortly..
